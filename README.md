# Overview
This is a final project for the class CS-554 Web Programming II. We created a social media website for self learning students to connect with other students learning the same topics.

## Usage
To start the website, run the following. 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:gilgga/Summit.git
$ cd Summit
$ docker-compose up
```
The web server will run on localhost:3000.
